# Procedural-and-other
Unity project playing with procedural generation, gravity and why not both at the same time? 

Includes a small GUI to place planets and watch them as their gravities interract, and a few tools to generate terrains and planets. 

# Requirements 
Unity 2020.3

# Usage
You can use the app in the editor. SampleScene implements in-editor terrain generation tools, Gravity testing implements a gravitational simulation in play mode that allows you to place planets as you want. Planet Gen Tests is an in-editor planet generator. The in-editor tools use a lot of Perlin noise, so you probably want to know at least the basics of it to understand the options in the editor.
